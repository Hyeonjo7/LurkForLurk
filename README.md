# LurkForLurk
A project collaborated with 2 other developers to create a friendly variation of LinkedIn. 
Our goal is to make a functioning login page with a home page where users can post and view others' posts.
Similar to other social media, we also plan on implementing a chat page for live talking between users.

This project's backend has been completed at a foundational level with a temporary json as our backend, while the frontend was to be completed using HTML and CSS.

## Current Update
To research and plan how to implement a live chat page and frontpage design
